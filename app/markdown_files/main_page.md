### What is the KK Multiple?
                    
The KK Multiple is an innovative tool used for technical analysis in Bitcoin investing proposed by <br> K. Selveira and K. Cheliadinova, based on Mayer Multiple.

The Mayer Multiple is calculated by taking the price of Bitcoin and dividing it by the N day moving average value. The number of days is optimised every month for best results.
